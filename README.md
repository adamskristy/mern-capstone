##### Project Status: WIP

For this project, you will be making another full CRUD app using the technologies outlined below.

### Minimum Project Requirements
- A working full-stack application, built by you, using the MERN stack: Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and React.
- At least two models with full CRUD.
- Follow proper MVC backend structure (models, controllers, routes in separate folders)
- As many pages and components as you need
- Include sign up/login (authentication) functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
- Use of axios and local storage for tokens
- Use of a CSS framework for styling (Bootstrap, MaterialUI, Skeleton, Tailwind, etc.)
- At least one GitHub commit per day (at least 15)
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public
- A README.md file (should include a link to your hosted working website) 

### Stretch goals:
- Manage at least some part of state with the useReducer and useContext hooks (together) or Redux (`npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`) 
- Pull from a third party API - either client side with AJAX or server-side with an NPM

## Motivations

I chose this app due to the many hours spent researching, googling, and watching tutorials. I found a lot of great resources, especially articles and blogs, however I know today, most people would prefer to watch a video. I wanted a way to share and expose people to those written resources.

## Lessons Learned
It was really hard to come up with an idea for this project. All the recommendation I found online didnt spark any interest for me. It took a lot of brainstorming and whiteboard in Miro to finally settle on an idea. We were on a deadline as well so I didnt start this project off the way I normally do, which is with some type of plan our outline of what the site should do and how it looks. Because of that I had to redo my code and fix a lot of unecessary mistakes. Once I finally stopped and got my idea together the rest fell in place.

## Roadmap
- filtering options
- like buttons or star ratings
- comments feature
- pagination
- loading indicator for login/sign up
- conditional rendering for edit/delete buttons
- better error handling
- display message on profile page
- better responsiveness
